# How to build

## First time

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

## Normal build

```bash
cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

The build can be found and run in `/build/Debug/`

# Running the build

This should be as simple as going into `/build/Debug/` and running the .exe since all neccessary files should be copied over.
